 * 
 *        1. You may implement HashTable with open addressing discussed in
 *        class; You can choose one of those three: linear probing, quadratic
 *        probing or double hashing. The only restriction is that it should not
 *        restrict the size of the input domain (i.e., it must accept any key)
 *        or the number of inputs (i.e., it must grow as necessary).
 * 
 *        2. Your HashTable should rehash as appropriate (use load factor as
 *        shown in the class).
 * 
 *        3. To use your HashTable for WordCount, you will need to be able to
 *        hash strings. Implement your own hashing strategy using charAt and
 *        length. Do NOT use Java's hashCode method.
 * 
 *        4. HashTable should be able to grow at least up to 200,000. We are not
 *        going to test input size over 200,000 so you can stop resizing there
 *        (of course, you can make it grow even larger but it is not necessary).
 * 
 *        5. We suggest you to hard code the prime numbers. You can use this
 *        list: http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100000.txt NOTE: Make sure you
 *        only hard code the prime numbers that are going to be used. Do NOT
 *        copy the whole list!
 * 
 *        TODO: Develop appropriate tests for your HashTable.
